# File: history.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "player history" information for 
# the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Background information:
# Pieces of player backstory are chosen from "charts", which are lists of
# phrases or sentences with similar general meaning.

# 'chart' lines give the number of the current chart, the number of the chart
# that will be used next (or 0 if the last chart), and a cutoff for choosing
# the current line.  If the first field in two chart lines is the same, the
# second should be as well, to maintain consistent choices and end up with
# something readable.

# 'phrase' lines are the actual chart entries which make up the history.

# Background information (see below)
#
# Chart progression by race:
#   Human           -->  1 -->  2 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Green Elf       -->  4 -->  7 -->  9 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#   Grey Elf        -->  5 -->  7 -->  9 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#   Hobbit          --> 10 --> 11 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   Petty-Dwarf     --> 13 --> 14 --> 57 --> 58 --> 59 --> 60 --> 61
#   Dwarf/Longbeard --> 16 --> 17 --> 18 --> 57 --> 58 --> 59 --> 60 --> 61
#   Druadan         --> 19 --> 23 --> 62 --> 63 --> 64 --> 66
#   Adan            --> 20 --> 21 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#   High Elf        -->  6 -->  7 -->  9 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#   Maia            --> 25 --> 26 --> 67 --> 68
#   Dark Elf        --> 28 --> 29 --> 54 --> 55 --> 56
#   Ent             --> 31 --> 32 --> 74 --> 75 --> 76
#   Beorning        --> 80 --> 81 -->  3 --> 50 --> 51 --> 52 --> 53
#
# This table *must* be correct or the history may look very silly.

# Note that the "spacing" in the "description" lines is very important!
